We have several of the usual means of contact:

{% include contacts.md %}

We need our own [documentation](/documentation) quite desperately. If you want to send us pull requests, or discuss how we should run the documentation project, get in touch.

We're in great need of people who like to write web content, draw logos, tweet, make things pretty, and general do all the things that at no point involve debugging linker errors. If that's your cup of tea, do help us out, will ya?

We would love more testers - fetch [development packages](/download) and give us feedback. If you have ideas about how to do testing better, we would love that too.

Supposedly there are bugs as well, both in the [core] and [base] project. We love it for there to be fewer of those.

If you're interested in one of these things, or something else you'd like to us about, find us on IRC or send an email.
