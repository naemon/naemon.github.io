Naemon is created by the community, for the community. While the legal stuff isn't done quite yet, we are working toward setting up an independent, non-commercial legal entity to manage the Naemon project. We wish to thereby ensure that decisions are based on technical merit and what we, the users, want - not what earns someone's employer the most money. We believe this can only happen through independence and transparency.

This does not mean that we're hostile towards commercial offerings based on the Naemon code - quite the opposite: we wish to see our code used and reused in as many settings and distributions as possible, commercial as well as noncommercial, all competing on equal ground with each other.

### Why yet another fork?
We like Nagios Core, and we would have liked to contribute to its further development - in fact, as part of our team you'll find administrators with plenty of experience from huge Nagios installations, as well as many of the developers who contributed towards turning Nagios 3 into Nagios 4, including Andreas Ericsson, who wrote about 95% of those patches. Alas, for reasons that appear to be related to politics/profit, we no longer feel welcome in the Nagios Core community.

We do feel many of the many forks and rewrites Nagios has spawned have interesting ideas, but many of them are organized in ways that are vulnerable to creating the same kind of second-guessing of motivations. We would like to continue to explore the ideas we started to explore in Nagios 4, in terms of features, behaviour and functionality, and we would also like to explore project structure as well. Still, we believe we have much in common with many of the other projects, and hope that as we find our place in the open monitoring ecosystem, we'll be able to create a fruitful cooperation and exchange of ideas and code.
