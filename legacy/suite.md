The Naemon project includes a GUI, but not the old Nagios CGI interface - instead we have a fast, modern and more useful replacement, [Thruk](http://thruk.org). You can test the online demo of Thruk at [demo.thruk.org](http://demo.thruk.org).

We also bundle Livestatus, which is how Thruk communicates with the core.

We'd like for more relevant tools to join our project. As we're about to be an [independent entity](/project.html), we want our name to be a guarantee that we are owned by our members who work together.
