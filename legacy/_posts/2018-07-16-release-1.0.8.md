Today we released the version 1.0.8 of naemon-core and naemon-livestatus. Thanks to all
people who were involved in this release. This release addresses some issues during package
updates. If you still have problems, try to remove the obsolute naemon-tools package first.
Naemon tools have been merged into the naemon-core package.

Head on to [the download section](/download) or check out the [changelog](/documentation/usersguide/whatsnew.html) for
a detailed list of changes.
