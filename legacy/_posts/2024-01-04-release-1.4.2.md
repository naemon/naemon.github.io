Today we released the version 1.4.2 of naemon-core and naemon-livestatus. This release
contains performance improvements and some bugfixes as listed in detail on the changelog
page.

Make sure to rebuild or update all NEB modules because the `CURRENT_NEB_API_VERSION`
has changed. For example use naemon-livestatus >= 1.4.2

Head on to [the download section](/download) or check out the [changelog](/documentation/usersguide/whatsnew.html) for
a detailed list of changes.
