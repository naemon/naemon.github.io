We are excited to attend the Open Source Monitoring Conference 2024, which will take place from 19 - 21 November in Nuremberg.
The OSMC is a great opportunity for professionals and enthusiasts in the open source monitoring community to come together, share knowledge, and network.

If you would like to get in touch with the Naemon Developers Sven and Daniel, this is your chance!

We look forward to seeing you there!
