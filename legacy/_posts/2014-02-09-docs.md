Today we started the documentation project and you are welcome to help out.
There is lot of stuff to write and the more people help, the less documentation
has to be written by single person.

The issues with our build system have been sorted out and it seems quite stable
and we only have to tweak some last things, like better init scripts, before
we finally release the first version of Naemon.
