Since we started the documentation project, we made great progress. Mostly due to
the help of Johan. Thanks.

The initial import of the original documentation pages has been finished, but there
are still pages left to be reviewed. This can be done by anyone who wants to help
making our documentation awesome. Just follow the steps as [described here](/documentation/faq/#help_extending_the_documentation).

All pages left over for review got a *review_required* tag at the top of the page so
they can easily be found. A simple grep would also work:

```bash
  %> grep -r review_required documentation/usersguide/
```

The doxygen documentation has already been ported into the website and is now
part of the normal developer documentation.

We now even have [Travis CI tests for our website](https://travis-ci.org/naemon/naemon.github.io/).

Next steps are:

- finish review
- complete missing pages
- include documentation in source tarball
