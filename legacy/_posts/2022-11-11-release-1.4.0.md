Today we released the version 1.4.0 of naemon-core and naemon-livestatus. This release
includes a new internal command to expire acknowledgements, and a few bugfixes.

Due to object structure changes, NEB modules should be re-built when upgrading to 1.4.0

Head on to [the download section](/download) or check out the [changelog](/documentation/usersguide/whatsnew.html) for
a detailed list of changes.
