Due to the recent changes on freenode, the official Naemon support irc channel has moved to libera.chat.
The new address is: irc://libera.chat/naemon and there is also a web chat available via
[kiwiirc.com](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat/#naemon)
Please update you irc clients and say hello if you like.

The [community](/community/) section always contains a list of ways to contact us.
