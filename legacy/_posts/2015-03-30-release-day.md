Today we released our first bug fix release after the 1.0 in February.

There is one bug fixed which made the debian packages from the 1.0 look
like 0.9 packages. The other bugs are related to the `shadownaemon` tool.

So the main reason for this release is the new 1.88 release from [Thruk](http://thruk.org) which
comes with [lots of handy features and bugfixes](http://thruk.org/changelog.html).

Continue to [the download section](/download) or check out the [changelog](/documentation/usersguide/whatsnew.html) for
a detailed list of changes.
