Summer vacation is over and we are making good progress on the way to a stable
1.0 release which is planned for the next weeks. A change to make timeperiods
more sane and some final testing are hopefully done till the weekend.

Till the final release, you can test the [daily releases](/download/#development_snapshot) which are almost exactly
like the stable release, the only different part is the version string.

Also last news call to help reviewing a few last documentation pages is still valid.

One last note, Andreas will talk about Naemon on the [OSMC in Nuremberg](http://www.netways.de/en/osmc/osmc_2014/programm/andreas_ericsson_naemon/) this year.
