#### What Are The Differences To Nagios

A lot of open Nagios 4 issues have been fixed in Naemon.

Also we removed the CGIs in favor of the Thruk gui.

### Core

#### Run Naemon With GDB

For error tracing its often useful to have a backtrace. For example if naemon
crashes. You can start naemon with GDB like this.

{{ site.warn }}All commands should be run as the 'naemon' user.{{ site.end }}

Livestatus requires us to export or set LD_PRELOAD before running GDB, so we
first have to find that library:

```bash
  %> find /lib/ /usr/lib/ /lib64/ /usr/lib64/ -name libpthread.so.0
  /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0
```

If available you should install the `naemon-core-dbg` package which
contains additional debugging symbols that makes troubleshooting a lot easier.

Then run Naemon with GDB, you will have to type `run` after the prompt:

```bash
 %>LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libpthread.so.0 gdb --args /usr/bin/naemon-dbg /etc/naemon/naemon.cfg
   GNU gdb (GDB) 7.0.1-debian

   and "show warranty" for details.
   This GDB was configured as "i486-linux-gnu".
   For bug reporting instructions, please see:
   <http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/>...
   Reading symbols from /usr/bin/naemon-dbg...done.
   (gdb) run
```

After typing 'run' you need to wait till the program crashes or exists otherwise.
In our case we just used 'kill -11' to fake a segfault in the core:

```bash
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xb7fe2424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb)
```

By typing `bt` you will get the desired backtrace:

```
(gdb) bt
#0  0xb7fe2424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
#1  0xb7f1b6f6 in epoll_wait () from /lib/i686/cmov/libc.so.6
#2  0x080c3d07 in iobroker_poll (iobs=0x80ef0b0, timeout=1500) at iobroker.c:348
#3  0x08077b18 in event_execution_loop () at events.c:1060
#4  0x080821db in main (argc=2, argv=0xbffff644) at naemon.c:768
```

Now go to the [naemon issues](https://github.com/naemon/naemon/issues) page and file a
new bug after having a look if this hasn't been reported yet.

### Documentation

#### Help Extending The Documentation

Helping writing documentation is really easy and much appreciated. Most pages
are written in either Markdown ([Cheat Sheet][markdown]) or HTML. The website
itself uses [bootstrap][bootstrap] for a simple and nice layout.

See our [Bootstrap and Markdown guide](/documentation/faq/bootstrap-markdown-guide.html) for more info

Please see our [Usersguide guidelines](/documentation/faq/usersguide-guidelines.html) for some basic information how we write our documentation

##### Small Changes
Small changes like typos can be corrected and submitted directly on [github][githubdocs] via the edit button.
<p>![github edit button](images/githubedit.png "Github Edit Button")</p>
Just navigation to the page you want to change and send a pull request via the online editor of github.
Read more about the [online editor][githubedithelp]...


##### Larger Changes
Larger changes should be tested and reviewed locally before submitting them. Also
it's good practice to talk to a team member before spending large amounts of time
in things we eventually won't accept for whatever reasons.
The [developer guide](/documentation/developer/website.html) contains instructions on
how to run a local Jekyll server.
When done, just submit a normal pull request.
