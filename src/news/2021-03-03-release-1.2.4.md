Today we released the version 1.2.4 of naemon-core and naemon-livestatus. We made some performance improvements
during the config check when using many servicegroups. And Livestatus has been made way faster when accessing
the contacts column especially when having many contacts and contactgroups.

Head on to [the download section](/download) or check out the [changelog](/documentation/usersguide/whatsnew) for
a detailed list of changes.
