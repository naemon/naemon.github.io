Today we released the version 1.3.0 of naemon-core and naemon-livestatus. There
is a new vault broker api along with more secure environment handling.

Having environment variables in your command line in the form of:

`VARIABLE=value... $USER1$/check_something args...`

Then the environment variable is removed from the command line and set before
the check command is started. Previously the hole command would have been
passed to the shell and the variables would be visible in the ps process list.

The vault broker api adds some extensions to the NEB api to move macro handling
to neb modules. This makes it possible to fill macro values dynamically from
broker modules. There is an example which uses a vim encrypted resource.cfg like
vault at https://github.com/naemon/naemon-vimcrypt-vault-broker
But usage is not limited to encrypted macros, this is just an example of how this
new api can be used.
See an example in the [Vault API documentation](/documentation/developer/neb_broker.html).

The Livestatus module got 2 bugfixes regarding an issue which prevented naemon
reloads when using the tcp listener and another issue where contacts would be
listed multiple times.

Head on to [the download section](/download) or check out the [changelog](/documentation/usersguide/whatsnew) for
a detailed list of changes.
