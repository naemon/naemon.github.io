Naemon has reached an incredible milestone: 10 years of being a fast, flexible and reliable monitoring suite! While we missed the exact anniversary date by a [few days](https://github.com/naemon/naemon-core/releases/tag/v1.0.0), we are very excited to release our new website today. The new site is based on VitePress, can be searched and we finally managed to re-draw all images and diagrams as scalable vector images.

Thank you for being part of the Naemon journey!
