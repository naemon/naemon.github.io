### What Is Naemon?

Naemon is an Open Source system and network monitoring application.
It watches hosts and services that you specify, alerts you when things go bad and
notifies you when they get better.

Naemon is based on Nagios 4.0.2 and aims to be a drop in replacement for Nagios.

Nagios used to refer to the community project, but when Nagios Enterprises was created,
Nagios in all official communication started referring to Nagios-the-product (XI).
As Nagios Enterprises had an open core model, they started to refer to their open
core as Nagios Core. Naemon Suite is currently roughly equivalent to Nagios Core,
which makes Naemon Core the equivalent of "Nagios Core Core".

Naemon is the general term of the entire "Naemon Suite" that consists of two different
parts, Naemon Core and the <a href="http://thruk.org" target="_blank">Thruk Monitoring Webinterface</a>.
We will generally refer to Naemon Suite as just Naemon.

Some of the many features of Naemon include:

* Monitoring of network services (SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, PING, etc.)
* Monitoring of host resources (processor load, disk usage, etc.)
* Simple plugin design that allows users to easily develop their own service checks
* Parallelized service checks
* Thruk Monitoring Webinterface to edit settings and view current network status, problem
  history, log files, sla reports, dashboards, business processes, etc.
* Ability to define network host hierarchy using "parent" hosts, allowing detection of
  and distinction between hosts that are down and those that are unreachable
* Contact notifications when service or host problems occur and get resolved (via email, pager, or user-defined method)
* Ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events for proactive problem resolution
* Automatic log file rotation
* Support for implementing redundant monitoring hosts



### Components

#### Naemon core
The naemon core is the process that does the actual monitoring of your system.

#### Livestatus
Livestatus is an interface that your tools can use to query the Naemon core like a database.
<a href="/documentation/usersguide/livestatus.html">Read more about Livestatus.</a>

#### Thruk
Thruk is the UI shipped with the Naemon Suite.

The Thruk documentation is at [its own page][thruk].

#### Plugins
The monitoring application itself is quite useless without plugins to actually checks things for you.
Check out [monitoring plugins][monplugins] for a large, well maintained collection of core plugins.

The more esoteric your needs are, the higher the probability that your needs wont be covered
by the monitoring plugins package. You can find a large body of plugins - maintained by their
individual authors - at [monitoring exchange][monexchange]. You can also easily write
your own - see the [monitoring plugins][monplugins] project.

### System Requirements

The only requirement of running Naemon is a machine running Linux (or UNIX variant) that has network
access and a C compiler installed (if installing from source code).

You are <i>not required</i> to use the CGIs included with Naemon. However, if you
do decide to use them, you will need to have the following software installed...

* A web server (preferrably <a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_top">Apache</a>)
* Perl
