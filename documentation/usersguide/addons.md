### Introduction

There are a lot of "addon" software packages that are available for Naemon. Addons can be used to extend Naemons functionality or integrate Naemon with other applications.

Addons are available for:

* Managing the config files through a web interface
* Monitoring remote hosts (*NIX, Windows, etc.)
* Submitting passive checks from remote hosts
* Simplifying/extending the notification logic
* ...and much more

You can find many addons for Naemon by visiting:

* <a href="http://www.monitoringexchange.org/">MonitoringExchange.org</a>

I'll give a brief introduction to a few of the addons for Naemon...

### NRPE

NRPE is an addon that allows you to execute <a href="plugins.html">plugins</a> on remote Linux/Unix hosts.
This is useful if you need to monitor local resources/attributes like disk usage, CPU load, memory usage,
etc. on a remote host. Similar functionality can be accomplished by using the *check_by_ssh* plugin, although
it can impose a higher CPU load on the monitoring machine - especially if you are monitoring hundreds or thousands of hosts.

The NRPE addon and documentation can be found at <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">http://www.nagios.org/</a>.



### NSCA

hosts to the Naemon running on the monitoring server.

common addons. Naemon is currently bundled in the OMD-NC version, which is available

### others
There are lots of addons for Nagios and Naemon. Most Nagios addons should be 1:1 compatible with Naemon.
You might have to adjust some paths and users, but as both share a lot of code, most addons and plugins
should just work.
